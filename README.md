## Features 

All the information displayed on the website and technologies used to create it.  

### General  

*Header and footer* – Are the same across all pages.  

![Header and Footer](assets/website-images/) 

*Header* – It contains navigation bar and responsive website logo - leading to home page across all pages. In the initially design the logo and menu bar were supposed be opposite each other, but because of lack of knowledge and time I had to make two seperate containers for both. This was easier to design. Because of this choice the two are on the opposite end of view port to each other. 

![Footer](assets/website-images/) 

*Footer* – It contains social media icons and "Educational Purposes" statement.  

![Home Page](assets/website-images/)

*Home Page* – is brief description of the website and content.
