## Features 

All the information displayed on the website and technologies used to create it.  

### General  

*Header and footer* – Are the same across all pages.  

*Header* – It contains navigation bar and responsive website logo - leading to home page across all pages. In the initially design the logo and menu bar were supposed be opposite each other, but because of lack of knowledge and time I had to make two seperate containers for both. This was easier to design. Because of this choice the two are on the opposite end to each other. 
![Header and Footer](assets/images/website-screenshots/header.jpg) 


*Footer* – It contains social media icons and "Educational Purposes" statement. On the initial design it was meant to all be inline. However for the lack of knowledge and time constrains I have made the statement and social media icons to be on the center.
