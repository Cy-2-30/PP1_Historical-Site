                    <h2>Origins</h2>
                        <p>
                            <i>Khoekhoe</i> is an ethnic designator. It refers to several populations which speak closely related languages 
                            and are historical pastoralist communities in the South African Cape region, through to Namibia, where <i>Khoekhoe</i> 
                            populations of Nama and Damara people are prevalent ethnicities. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many <strong>Khoesān people</strong> are the direct descendants of a very early dispersal of anatomically modern humans to Southern 
                            Africa 150,000 years ago. Their languages show a vague typological similarity, largely confined to the prevalence of 
                            click consonants. They are not verifiably derived from a common proto language, but are today split into at least 
                            three separate and unrelated language families <i>(Khoe-Kwadi, ǃUi-Taa and Kxʼa)</i>. It has been suggested that the 
                            <i>Khoekhoe people</i> may represent Late Stone Age arrivals to Southern Africa, displaced by <strong>Bantu</strong> immigration.

                    <h3>What happened, to tip the balance?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Changes in the climate. Before 22,000 years ago, the southern part of Africa where the <strong>Khoisan</strong> lived was wetter, with more
                            precipitation, compared to the dryer western and central parts of the continent where other groups lived. A dryer climate 
                            meant fewer wild game and less food, which translates into fewer children. So other populations dropped significantly while
                            the <i>Khosian's</i> population stayed about the same. But after the last ice age ended, the climate changed, and for reasons we don't 
                            understand the other African populations expanded, and the exponential growth of humans across the earth began. 
                        </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>What about other skills and types of knowledge particular to the Khoisan?</h3>
                        <p>
                            They have incredible knowledge about animal behavior and about the environment. Where you and I would only see plants and scrub and thorn
                            and dry wood, they see a lot of things you can eat. If you walk with a <i>Bushman</i> in the bush, he is constantly eating because he always finds
                            something to nibble or chew on, and of course this is precious knowledge that we do not have. This is also their pharmacy, the herbs or the 
                            natural substances within the plants that will help them when they have ailments. Even the elders have pristine hearing and unobstructed vision.
                            And it is understandable if your life depends on your hunting skills.
